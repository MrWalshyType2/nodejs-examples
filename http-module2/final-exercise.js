/* Create a simple Todo API
 * 
 * Your task is to create an API using the http module in Node.js to allow for CRUD functionality against 
 * todo items, that is the ability to:
 * 
 * - Create
 * - Read
 * - Update
 * - Delete
 * 
 * todo items.
 * 
 * The structure you choose is upto you for this exercise, you may do this all in one file or split your work
 * into multiple files (separation of concerns).
 * 
 * NOTE: As we have not covered path parameters with the HTTP module, you must make use of query parameters instead. You will also need to use the
 *       request body for sending payloads of data for creating or modifying resources on the API and the response body for returning data.
